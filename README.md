## Description

<p>Clean Relay is a community-driven mobile application designed to empower users in actively contributing to the improvement of their neighborhoods. With a focus on enhancing local environments, Clean Relay allows individuals to effortlessly report issues and concerns they encounter on the streets, such as potholes, graffiti, or damaged infrastructure. Users can submit detailed problem descriptions along with location tags, creating a dynamic, real-time map of community-reported issues.</p>

<p>What sets Clean Relay apart is its unique point-based reward system â€“ users earn points for their contributions, fostering a sense of pride and accomplishment. These points not only recognize and appreciate the reporting user's efforts but also incentivize others to step up and address reported issues, fostering a collaborative spirit in maintaining clean and vibrant communities.</p>

<p>Join Clean Relay today to be an active participant in the positive transformation of your neighborhood.</p>
